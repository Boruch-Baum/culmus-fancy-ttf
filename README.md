# culmus-fancy-ttf

TrueType versions of the Hebrew fonts from package '[culmus-fancy](http://culmus.sourceforge.net/)'.

As of 2017-06-25, version 0.0.20051018-3 of package 'culmus-fancy' was
distributing its fonts in Postscript format. This repository is for
people who want / need TrueType versions of those fonts.

Please let me know if:

a] This is packaged for a distribution, so I can link to it.
   - [Arch Linux (AUR)](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/culmus-fancy-ttf) - ([2018-07](https://github.com/Boruch-Baum/culmus-fancy-ttf/issues/1))

b] The original package is updated to include TrueType fonts, so I can
delete this repository.

c] Some superior version of this collection exists elsewhere, so I can defer to it.

These fonts were created by processing the original Postscript fonts through '[fontforge](http://fontforge.github.io/en-US/)'.
